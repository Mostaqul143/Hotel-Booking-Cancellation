## ðŸ“Š Hotel Booking Analysis Project

In this project, I conducted an analysis of hotel bookings using a dataset of hotel reservations. I utilized pivot tables to uncover insights into booking patterns, cancellations, and guest demographics.

Here are some key findings:

### Cancellation Analysis:

- Analyzed cancellation rates based on guest types (Couple, Family, Single) and room preferences (Desired, Un-Desired).
- Discovered that the majority of cancellations were made by guests booking Desired rooms at City Hotels.

### Hotel Comparison:

- Compared the total number of bookings between City Hotels and Resort Hotels.
- Found that City Hotels had a higher total number of bookings compared to Resort Hotels.

### Booking Trends:

- Examined booking trends over the course of the year (January to December).
- Identified fluctuations in bookings and cancellations throughout the year, with peaks during the summer months.

Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights for hotel management to optimize their booking strategies and improve guest satisfaction.
